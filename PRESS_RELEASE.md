There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows.

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

# Project Name
Aris' Blue (Game) Archive

## Heading
  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.
Aris' Game Archiver/Lister Tool
## Sub-Heading
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.
This is for the gamers who want either a completion list for the games they have yet to play or a wishlist for the games they want.
## Summary
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.
This product will keep track of a list of games for you. While the main purpose of this product is to keep a list of the games you have played (with favorite games being the games they enjoyed playing the most), This product could also technically be used to allow gamers to keep a list of the games that they want (with favorite games being the games they want the most), whatever floats your boat. Each game will have a link to the RAWG website, which can tell you more about each game. You can add more games to your lists, remove games from the list, and favorite/unfavorite games in the list. You can also sort your list by name, release year, or rating.
## Problem
  > Describe the problem your product solves.
Sometimes, you just need a way to keep track of something. In this case, the "something" is a list of video games that you have played (or haven't played).
## Solution
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.
We solve this problem by making a product that retrieves games from an api and allows the user to store/save said game records in a database that gets displayed as a list that can be sorted by a certain attribute of each game. Each game in the list can be favorited or unfavorited.
## Quote from You
  > A quote from a spokesperson in your company.
"I helped to create this because I wanted people to have an even better gaming experience. Bum, bum bum bum!" -Aris
## How to Get Started
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.
Put the game name in the search bar, press search, look at the resulting list of games, click "add" on the games that you want to add to your list. You can then click the favorite button to favorite or unfavorite each game in your list, click "remove" to remove a game from your list, and/or select one of the sorting options from the sorting drop-down menu to sort your games.
## Customer Quote
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.
"Wow, it really gud and it make go hehe cuz I liek the bideo games. I can know al teh gaems that I liek and played so I can go bac to them in teh future."
-Joey, 5 years old
