# MVP (Solo) Project

<br>

__Q:__ What is the required output?

__A:__ A compelling product presentation delivered to your classmates.

### Getting Started:

To build on your learning of core engineering concepts, we will begin thinking about how to actually manage projects. Engineering management is a deep skill and discipline with lots of history and academic writing. We will focus on just some highlights of content to give a very brief context of how we arrive here.

* Use an [Iterative and incremental development process](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_and_incremental_development) instead of a [Waterfall Process](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model)
